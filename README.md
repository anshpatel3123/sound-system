# Sound System

## Overview
This project is a Python-based **sound processing system** that enables users to **record, visualize, and analyze audio signals**. Using `sounddevice` for recording and `thinkdsp` for waveform manipulation, this system provides an interactive way to explore digital sound signals.

## Features
- **Audio Recording**: Captures live audio using the microphone.
- **Waveform Visualization**: Plots the recorded sound signal for analysis.
- **Signal Processing**: Supports operations like segmentation and transformation of waveforms.
- **Matplotlib Integration**: Displays waveform graphs for better understanding.
- **Uses `thinkdsp` Library**: Provides tools for working with digital signal processing.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended). Install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib sounddevice thinkdsp
